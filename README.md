## Welcome!
I make Roblox games and I'm interested in game development!
I'm also interested in making software and websites - you could say I'm a tech savvy individual.
When I'm not developing, I'm usually outside or gaming. It depends on how I'm feeling and how motivated I am. 
I don't feel that motivated to update my website right now, so it's kind of outdated.
I use he/him pronouns and think of myself as pansexual.
I'm not in a relationship right now - taking a break from it, actually.
Thank you for taking the time to read this and get to know me if you haven't already!
